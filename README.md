# IBM-DS-Capstone
This repository holds the files for my data science capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional certification.

All code is in Python and the project revolves around using Foursquare's API to utilize location data in Jupyter notebooks.

The Jupyter notebook titled "foursquare_API_intro" is a useful lab that demonstrates the basics of using the Foursquare API for location data.

The Jupyter notebook titled "clustering_k_means" is a useful lab that demonstrates the basics of k-means clustering using Scikit-learn in Python.

The Jupyter notebook titled "neighborhoods-ny" is a useful lab that demonstrates applying k-means clustering to geographical data obtained using the Foursquare API. Additionally, the folium library is used to view the clusters on top of a map of New York.
